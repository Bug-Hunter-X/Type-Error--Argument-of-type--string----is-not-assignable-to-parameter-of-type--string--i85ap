# Type Error in TypeScript: Incorrect Argument Type

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an array to a function expecting a string. The `greeter` function is designed to take a single string as input but is called with an array. This results in a type error.

The solution shows how to correctly handle the array, providing multiple examples of how to iterate and process each string within the array.
